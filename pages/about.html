    <h2 class="st-Section_Title">About</h2>
    <div class="st-Section_Intro">I taught myself how to code. Now I'm using my skills to build solutions for particulars, businesses and non-profits while taking courses to stay on the cutting edge of web technologies.</div>

        <h3 class="st-Section_Subtitle">What I do</h3>
        <p>My specialty is full-stack web development. What I mean is crafting RESTFull APIs with <span class="typo-Text-primary">Django</span> and consuming them with <span class="typo-Text-primary">Angular</span>. I have also worked with <span class="typo-Text-primary">Symfony</span> and <span class="typo-Text-primary">Vue.js</span>. I always deliver clean and maintainable test-driven code in Python, JavaScript and PHP. When they are ready for production, I often turn my web apps into native mobile or desktop apps using tools like <span class="typo-Text-primary">Ionic</span> and <span class="typo-Text-primary">Electron</span>.</p>
        <p>I also love to design and craft good looking websites from scratch with only HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript (as I did for this one you are browsing). But for larger projects I know how to take advantage of the power of libraries like <span class="typo-Text-primary">Bootstrap</span>, <span class="typo-Text-primary">jQuery</span> and <span class="typo-Text-primary">WordPress</span> to deliver powerful and customizable solutions to my clients.</p>

      <div>
        <h3 class="st-Section_Subtitle">Tools I use</h3>
        <p>As a web dev, I use so many tools in my daily tasks but, those I can't go by without are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="typo-Text-primary">Visual Studio Code</span>: All the coding happens there.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="typo-Text-primary">Google Chrome</span>: To check if everything works as expected.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="typo-Text-primary">Git</span>: To track all the changes in my code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="typo-Text-primary">Gravit Designer</span>: When I'm feeling inspired.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="st-Section_Subtitle">My interests</h3>
        <p>I currently have a big interest in <span class="typo-Text-primary">machine learning</span> and looking forward to take a course on it. I like to have deep conversations about tech with everyone. You can ping me on any of my social accounts if you are interested. I'll be happy to chat with you.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I'm probably reading a book, catching a movie, listening good music, walking around the city or just spending some quality time with friends and family.</p>
