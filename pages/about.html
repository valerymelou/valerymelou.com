    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class="section-intro">
      <p>I taught myself how to code. Now I'm using my skills to build solutions for particulars, businesses and non-profits while taking courses to stay on the cutting edge of web technologies.</p>

        <h3>What I do</h3>
        <p>My specialty is full-stack web development. What I mean is crafting RESTFull APIs with <strong>Django</strong> and consuming them with <strong>Angular</strong>. I have also worked with <strong>Symfony</strong> and <strong>Vue.js</strong>. I always deliver clean and maintainable test-driven code in Python, JavaScript and PHP. When they are ready for production, I often turn my web apps into native mobile or desktop apps using tools like <strong>Ionic</strong> and <strong>Electron</strong>.</p>
        <p>I also love to design and craft good looking websites from scratch with only HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript (as I did for this one you are browsing). But for larger projects I know how to take advantage of the power of libraries like <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong> and <strong>WordPress</strong> to deliver powerful and customizable solutions to my clients.</p>

        <h3>Tools I use</h3>
        <p>As a web dev, I use so many tools in my daily tasks but, those I can't go by without are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>: All the coding happens there.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Chrome</strong>: To check if everything works as expected.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Git</strong>: To track all the changes in my code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gravit Designer</strong>: When I'm feeling inspired.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>My interests</h3>
        <p>I currently have a big interest in <strong>machine learning</strong> and looking forward to take a course on it. I like to have deep conversations about tech with everyone. You can ping me on any of my social accounts if you are interested. I'll be happy to chat with you.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I'm probably reading a book, catching a movie, listening good music, walking around the city or just spending some quality time with friends and family.</p>
