    By day, I lead the technical strategy as the CTO at

    >. By night (and on weekends), I'm in the trenches building my own products
    in public. This dual role gives me a unique perspective: I understand both
    high-level architecture and the hands-on details of crafting a product from
    the ground up.

  <h2>My Story</h2>

  <p>
    My journey into tech started right here in Cameroon, driven by a simple
    curiosity: how can we use code to create things that help people?
  </p>

  <p>That question still drives me today.</p>

  <p>
    I believe in pragmatic solutions and the power of community. That's why I'm
    a vocal advocate for building in public. I share my process openly (the
    wins, the bugs, and the lessons learned) because I believe transparency
    makes us all better developers.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm proud to be part of the vibrant

    community, contributing to the growth of the local tech ecosystem.
  </p>

  <h2>Let's connect</h2>

  <p>
    I'm always open to discussing new projects, sharing ideas, or just
    connecting with fellow developers and builders.
