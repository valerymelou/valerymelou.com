      A little about me
    </h1>
    <p>
      My developer journey started in 2012-2013 with a book from
      <a
        href="https://openclassrooms.com/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        ui-link
        >OpenClassroom</a
      >
      (then called, <strong class="italic">Le Site du ZÃ©ro</strong>). The
      assignment was simple: build a website using PHP, HTML and CSS. But for
      me, it sparked a fascination with the possibilities of the web. I spent
      countless hours tinkering, learning code like a secret language, and
      reveling in the satisfaction of seeing my creations come to life.

      Fast forward to today, and that early spark has ignited a full-fledged
      career. I've worn many hats - a freelancer tackling diverse projects, a
      team leader guiding developers, and most recently, a Director of
      Operations at
      <a href="https://mboadigital.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener" ui-link
        >MBOA DIGITAL</a
      >, ensuring the delivery of software projects in time and within budget.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm now specialized into web development. Building RESTfull APIs with
      <a
        href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        ui-link
        >Django</a
      >
      and
      <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" ui-link
        >Python</a
      >
      then, consuming those APIs with
      <a href="https://angular.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" ui-link
        >Angular</a
      >
      and
      <a
        href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        ui-link
        >Typescript</a
      >. I also have a strong focus on
      <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        ui-link
        >accessibility</a
      >
      when building web components because I believe the web should be
      accessible to everyone, even the impaired.
